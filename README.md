## Building
This repository is a fork of Asymptote v2.92 that adds support for TCP sockets and a new module base/web.asy that implements a web server. To build, run 
```sh
sed -i '2a #include <cstdint>' LspCpp/include/LibLsp/JsonRpc/serializer.h   # i don't know
autoheader
autoconf
./configure
time make asy; notify-send $?
# sudo make install
./test 
```
